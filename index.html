    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web 
developer", computer scientist
      <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that 
Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it 
would be cool if it were.

      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was 
founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe 
that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn 
Enough tutorials can benefit
     <strong> at least a billion</strong> 
people, and 
probably more.

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a 
leader in 
the movement to teach
      technical sophistication, the 
seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it 
to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and 
coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing 
when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least 
a billion</strong> people who can benefit 
from learning <em> technical sophistication</em>, 
probably more. To join our movement,
